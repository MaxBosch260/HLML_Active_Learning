# HLML_Active_Learning
This is the repository for sharing the code of my project for the UvA course 'Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning'. This repository contains a Python notebook with my code that can be run on Google Colab. To decrease computation time, I would suggest decreasing the number of seeds to use by removing elements from the 'random_states' list at the beginning of the notebook.
